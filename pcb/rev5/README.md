NinoTNC BLE rev5

The pogo pins (JLCPCB part number C5157269) are listed as Economy PCBA, but
really require Standard PCBA which is quite a bit more expensive. Also, the 
PCBA process for these pins is not super precise. All the boards I received 
had slight alignment issues. If you order this board, be sure to check the pins
for shorts.

In the next revision, I will source a different part for the pogo connector.

Files under the "fabrication" can be used for JLCPCB.
